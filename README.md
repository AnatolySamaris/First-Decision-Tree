# First DecisionTree
This is a Decision Tree model that's gonna be used for researching paper of mine, my teacher and other co-authors

In short, the topic of the paper is gamification of the educational process, where we research, how different game genres can influence to school subjects preferences. We consider these genres: shooters, puzzles, strategies, simulators, adventures, and the subjects as: Maths, Computer Science (CS), Physics, Russian Language, Literature, Social Science and Foreign Language.

To get samples, the survey in a school was made. Now we have only 196 observations (and the accuracy of the model is too low).
So we're gonna get more if the work will not be accidentially stopped.

The idea is to make the separated decision trees for every subject - you can see the results in the code.
What about the code - I wanted to learn to code the model by myself, without using some modules like scikit-learn to do my work without understanding what's going on in the model. So, it means that there can be some mistakes in the code...
